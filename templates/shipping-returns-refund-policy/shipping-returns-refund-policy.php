        <ol class="content-order-list" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>
                Sellers are responsible for coordinating the shipping and delivery of items to the buyer after a transaction is agreed upon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shipping costs, if applicable, should be discussed and agreed upon between the seller and the buyer before the transaction is finalized.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sellers must ensure that items are packaged securely and transported safely to prevent damage during shipping.
            </li>
            <li>
                WNDY does not handle or provide shipping services but may provide guidelines to help facilitate the process.

            <li>
                Any disputes related to shipping must be resolved directly between the seller and buyer.

        </ol>

        <p class="p_content" style="margin-top: 40px;">
            <b>2. Returns Policy</b> <br />
            Given the nature of the items traded on WNDY, returns may not always be possible or applicable. Therefore, it is crucial for sellers and buyers to clarify return policies before completing a transaction.
            <br />
            <b>For Sellers:</b>
        </p>

        <ol class="content-order-list" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>
                If you offer returns, this policy should be clearly stated in your product listing.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sellers must outline the conditions under which a return is accepted, including who bears the shipping costs for returns.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a return is agreed upon, it is the seller's responsibility to handle the return logistics and refund the buyer accordingly.

        <ol class="content-order-list" style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>
                Buyers must carefully review listings and confirm product details with the seller before finalizing the transaction to minimize the likelihood of returns.
            </li>
            <li>
                If a return is agreed upon, buyers must ensure the product is returned in the condition in which it was received.
            </li>
            <li>
                Buyers should initiate returns only if the product received significantly differs from the description or agreed-upon terms.
            </li>
        </ol>

            </li>
            <li>
                In the event of a dispute or chargeback, the buyer must contact their payment provider and notify the seller of the issue immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
                Buyers should ensure that all communication with the seller is well-documented to resolve any disputes regarding chargebacks.

        </ol>

        <p class="p_content">

            WNDY encourages users to contact us directly, through our support channels, to resolve any issues before initiating a chargeback.
